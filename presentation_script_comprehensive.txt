SECTION 1: OPENING & CONTEXT (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 1 - COVER]
Good morning/afternoon everyone. I'm [Your Name] from [Organization]. Today I'm excited to share a data-driven approach to understanding and forecasting Vietnam's tourism demand using machine learning. This 15-year study analyzes search patterns from nearly a thousand destinations and shows how we can use weather, economics, and historical trends to predict short-term tourism flows.

[SLIDE 2 - OBJECTIVES]
Our project has four clear objectives. First, to analyze 15 years of Vietnam tourism search trends from 2011 to 2025. Second, to build an accurate short-term forecasting model for each destination. Third, to identify which destinations are rising stars worth investing in. And fourth, to quantify exactly how weather impacts tourism demand—because weather is one factor we can plan around, even if we can't control it. By the end of this presentation, you'll see how data transforms into actionable tourism strategy.

[SLIDE 3 - DATA OVERVIEW]
Let me start with what we're working with. We integrated six major data sources:

Google Trends: 968 destinations tracked over 180 months—that's every month from January 2011 to December 2025. This gives us 174,240 destination-month observations of search interest.

Weather: Daily weather for all 34 provinces, aggregated into 5,916 monthly records with 7 extended variables I'll explain shortly.

Geography: Distance from each destination to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, latitude and longitude for spatial analysis.

Economics: Provincial GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product), population counts, and population density.

Social Media: YouTube video views and engagement metrics for destinations.

Seasonality: Peak month identification for 117 major destinations.

When merged, we have 278,436 rows with over 40 features spanning 15 years. This is rich enough to capture both long-term trends and seasonal cycles.

SECTION 2: METHODOLOGY (4 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 4 - DATA PIPELINE]
Our processing pipeline has six stages. First, we collect raw data from multiple sources. Second, we clean and validate—removing duplicates, fixing date formats, handling missing values. Third, we standardize province names across all datasets because different sources use different spellings, and one mismatch can link the wrong GRDP or weather to a destination. Fourth, we create extended weather features from daily to monthly aggregates. Fifth, we merge everything into one master dataset. Finally, we split by time—train on 2011-06 through 2025-06, test on 2025-07 through 2025-12—then train LightGBM and generate forecasts.

[SLIDE 5 - WEATHER EXTENDED FEATURES]
Now, the weather features are crucial and somewhat novel. Most tourism studies use simple monthly averages. We go further. From daily weather data, we compute seven monthly indicators:

- temp_min and temp_max: the coldest and hottest day that month
- temp_amplitude: the range between max and min—this measures weather volatility
- temp_std: standard deviation of daily temperatures—another volatility measure
- rainfall_total: cumulative monthly rainfall
- rainfall_max_daily: the wettest single day—indicates flood risk or extreme downpours
- rainfall_days: how many days it rained

The key insight here is that temperature amplitude significantly dampens travel intent. A month with temperatures swinging from 15°C to 35°C feels unpredictable and uncomfortable. Stable weather—say, consistently 24–28°C—encourages bookings. This insight directly informs our recommendations.

[SLIDE 6 - FEATURE ENGINEERING]
Beyond weather, we engineer features in four categories:

Lag features: traffic from 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months ago. The 12-month lag captures year-over-year trends and seasonality.

Rolling features: 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month moving averages and standard deviations. These smooth out noise and reveal momentum.

Time features: We encode month and quarter using sine and cosine to respect their cyclical nature. We also include year as a linear trend and derive a "traffic_yoy_change" feature measuring growth rate.

Destination features: Each destination's historical mean traffic, its province's average traffic, and a "seasonal amplitude" score if it has a known peak month.

Geography and economics round it out. In total, 41 features. This breadth lets the model see history, momentum, seasonality, weather, spatial patterns, and economic context all at once.

[SLIDE 7 - MACHINE LEARNING MODEL]
We chose LightGBM, a gradient boosting algorithm. Why? It handles nonlinear relationships well, it's fast even with many features, and it has built-in early stopping to prevent overfitting. Our configuration: 139 trees, learning rate 0.05, max 63 leaves per tree, and early stopping patience of 50 rounds.

Critically, we split data by time, not randomly. Training uses January 2011 through June 2025—260,490 rows. Testing uses July through December 2025—6,330 rows. No shuffling. This respects the time series nature and ensures we're truly forecasting future months, not interpolating known data.

SECTION 3: RESULTS & VALIDATION (3 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 8 - MODEL PERFORMANCE]
The results are excellent. On our held-out test set:
- R² = 0.9900 → the model explains 99% of variance in search traffic
- RMSE = 3.97 searches per month
- MAE = 0.87 searches per month

To put this in perspective, the median traffic is around 5 searches per month, and the mean is about 11. An average error under 1 search is very strong. Early stopping triggered at tree 139, meaning the model converged without overfitting. This accuracy gives us confidence to use forecasts for operational planning.

[SLIDE 9 - FEATURE IMPORTANCE]
What drives the model's predictions? Here are the top 10 features by importance:

1. traffic_yoy_change (1,709 splits)
2. traffic_lag_12m (1,484)
3. traffic_lag_1m (1,298)
4. traffic_rolling_mean_12m (319)
5. year (286)
6. dest_mean_traffic (270)
7. temp_amplitude (152)
8. temp_max (139)
9. rainfall_total (119)
10. grdp (118)

Notice: the top three are all historical traffic features. This tells us tourism demand is strongly path-dependent and seasonal. But weather appears prominently—temp_amplitude at #7, temp_max at #8, rainfall_total at #9. And GRDP rounds out the top 10, showing economic vitality matters. The message: you can't ignore history, but weather and economics add crucial signal.

[SLIDE 10 - KEY INSIGHTS]
Four insights stand out:

History matters most: Year-over-year change and 12-month lag account for over half the predictive power. Tourism demand is cyclical and persistent. If a destination was hot last summer, it's likely to be hot this summer unless something changes.

Short-term momentum: The 1-month lag and rolling means catch destinations that are heating up or cooling down right now. This is valuable for tactical adjustments.

Weather impacts demand: High temperature amplitude (volatile weather) reduces interest. Heavy rainfall (over 200mm/month) also suppresses demand. Stable, moderate weather (22-28°C, under 100mm rain) correlates with higher search traffic.

Economics influence attractiveness: Higher GRDP and population density boost a destination's baseline appeal, likely reflecting better infrastructure and services.

SECTION 4: FORECASTS & STRATEGIC INSIGHTS (4 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 11 - TOP 10 HOTTEST DESTINATIONS]
Based on our forecasts for the second half of 2025, the top 10 hottest destinations are:

1. Binh An (Can Tho): 1,050 searches/month
2. Phu Quoc (An Giang): 671
3. Xuan Son (Phu Tho): 470
4. Dong Thong (Bac Ninh): 438
5. Ho Tay (Lam Dong): 342
6. Ha Noi city (Ha Noi): 321
7. Phuong Hoang (Hai Phong): 288
8. Dong Tu Thuc (Thanh Hoa): 186
9. Ba Vi (Ha Noi): 173
10. Dong Khoi (Vinh Long): 167

Note the mix of established names like Phu Quoc and Ha Noi with emerging spots like Xuan Son and Dong Thong. Marketing and infrastructure budgets should prioritize these.

[SLIDE 12 - FASTEST GROWING DESTINATIONS]
Even more interesting are the growth rates. The top 10 fastest-growing destinations are:

1. Deo Ngang: +37.9% (19 → 27 searches)
2. Xuan Son: +36.3% (345 → 470)
3. Lam Kinh: +34.9% (31 → 42)
4. Ban Buoc: +29.5% (80 → 103)
5. Dong Tu Thuc: +28.9% (144 → 186)
6. Hoa Binh Hydropower: +25.9% (10 → 13)
7. Den Mau: +24.8% (12 → 15)
8. Tram Chim: +23.6% (11 → 13)
9. Military History Museum: +22.6% (18 → 22)
10. Independence Palace: +19.3% (40 → 48)

Notice a pattern: many are cultural or heritage sites—Lam Kinh, military museums, historic relics. This suggests a rising appetite for cultural tourism. These destinations are ideal for early investment before they become saturated.

[SLIDE 13 - TOP 10 HOT PROVINCES]
At the provincial level, the leaders are:

1. Phu Tho: 1,488 total traffic
2. Can Tho: 1,084
3. Ha Noi: 977
4. An Giang: 777
5. Lam Dong: 640
6. Ho Chi Minh City: 612
7. Bac Ninh: 553
8. Hai Phong: 543
9. Thanh Hoa: 394
10. Vinh Long: 289

Regional clusters emerge: Phu Tho–Ha Noi–Bac Ninh in the north form a cultural heritage corridor. Can Tho–An Giang–Vinh Long in the Mekong Delta form a river tourism cluster. These linkages suggest opportunities for multi-destination tours.

[SLIDE 14 - SEASONALITY ANALYSIS]
Seasonality is stark. Three peaks dominate the calendar:
- January-February: Tet (Lunar New Year)—domestic travel surges
- July-August: Summer holidays—family vacations, beach season
- December: Year-end, Christmas, international visitors

Troughs occur in March-April and September-October. These "shoulder seasons" are critical for revenue optimization. Promotions, discounts, and tailored products (festivals, conferences) can fill these gaps.

[SLIDE 15 - WEATHER IMPACT]
Quantifying weather effects:

Temperature amplitude: Months with low amplitude (5-8°C range) see 15-20% higher traffic than high-amplitude months (>12°C).

Rainfall: Under 100mm/month is favorable. Above 200mm/month, traffic drops 25-30% on average.

Ideal temperature: 22-28°C correlates with peak search interest. Use this in marketing: "comfortable weather, perfect for travel."

This means weather forecasts should inform campaign timing. If heavy rain is expected in Da Lat in October, push indoor activities or shift focus to drier regions.

SECTION 5: RECOMMENDATIONS & NEXT STEPS (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 16 - STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS]
Five actionable recommendations:

1. Focus on rising destinations: Prioritize Xuan Son, Dong Tu Thuc, Deo Ngang with infrastructure investment and targeted marketing. Early investment captures market share before saturation.

2. Stimulate shoulder seasons: March-April and September-October need demand stimulation. Offer bundles, discounts, or event programming. Example: cultural festivals in April, MICE tourism in September.

3. Optimize by weather: Use 14-day weather forecasts to adjust campaigns. Promote indoor attractions when rain is forecast, outdoor adventures when stable. Real-time responsiveness is now feasible.

4. Leverage cultural/heritage trends: The strong showing of museums, historical sites, and traditional festivals suggests opportunity. Consider VR/AR experiences to enhance engagement.

5. Build regional linkages: Package Phu Tho–Ha Noi–Bac Ninh tours (northern heritage) and Can Tho–An Giang–Vinh Long tours (Mekong Delta). Multi-day itineraries increase per-visitor spending and length of stay.

[SLIDE 17 - LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS]
Limitations to acknowledge:
- Google Trends measures search interest, not actual bookings or arrivals. We need validation against hotel occupancy or flight data.
- GRDP data has gaps—some provinces lack recent years, so we impute estimates.
- No integration yet with TikTok, Instagram, or flight booking data.

Next steps:
- Integrate booking.com, Agoda, and flight data for validation
- Add TikTok/Instagram sentiment analysis
- Build a real-time forecasting API that updates weekly
- Assess special events: festivals, extreme weather, policy changes

SECTION 6: CONCLUSION & Q&A (1 minute)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 18 - CONCLUSION]
To summarize: We've built a robust forecasting model with 99% accuracy using 278,000 observations over 15 years. The key drivers are historical traffic, seasonality, weather volatility, and economic vitality. Promising destinations include Xuan Son, Dong Tu Thuc, and a wave of cultural heritage sites. The strategy going forward should be data-driven, weather-aware, and focused on shoulder-season stimulation and fast-growing destinations.

This isn't just academic—it's operational intelligence. With weekly updates, tourism boards can adjust campaigns, hotels can optimize pricing, and investors can target opportunities with confidence.

ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
Q: Why Google Trends instead of actual visitor numbers?
A: Google Trends is available in real-time, free, and captures intent before booking. Actual visitor data lags by months. We plan to validate against booking data next.

Q: How often can you update forecasts?
A: Weekly. Google Trends updates weekly, weather updates daily. We can retrain monthly.

Q: What about COVID impact?
A: Data includes 2020-2021. The model learns from those anomalies. For future pandemics, we'd add policy dummy variables.

Q: Can this work for other countries?
A: Yes. The methodology is transferable. You need search data, weather, and economic indicators.

Q: What's the cost to implement?
A: Data is free (Google Trends, open weather). Computing is minimal—runs on a laptop. Main cost is analyst time for setup and interpretation.
